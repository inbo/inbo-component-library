# Ng-Inbo

This is a component library that was created to speed up development of INBO applications.

## Installation

To add the library to your project, you can execute the following command:

`ng add @inbo/ng-inbo --projectName <project-name>`

This command will install the library via npm and edit the angular.json of the project so the assets of the component
library (images and fonts) can be loaded. You can omit the projectName from the command, then the assets will be added
to the first project in the angular.json configuration.
